#Email Viewer Project README
This project is an Email Viewer created to apply and demonstrate my PHP skills. It allowed me to gain practical experience and improve my understanding of web development. Below, you'll find some key information about the project.

#Project Overview
Project Name: Email Viewer
Technology Used: PHP,JS, HTML,CSS
Database: MySQL
#Project Description
The Email Viewer is a web application I developed to practice my PHP programming skills and to create a practical tool for viewing and managing messages received through a "Contact Us" page. Here are some of the main features:

Email Display: The application fetches messages from the database and displays them. It provides a clean and minimalist user interface for users to view and manage messages.

Contact Form Integration: Messages are collected via a "Contact Us" form on the website. These messages are stored in a database and can be retrieved for viewing through the Email Viewer.

#How to Use
Clone the Repository: To get started with this project, you can clone this repository to your local machine.

#shell
Copy code
git clone (https://github.com/A-Simie/email_viewer.git)
Database Setup: Make sure you have a MySQL database set up. Update the database configuration in your PHP code to match your database credentials.

Run the Application: You can run the project on a local PHP server. Simply navigate to the project directory and use PHP's built-in server:

shell
Copy code
cd email-viewer
php -S localhost:8000
Access the Application: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000. You can view and manage the messages received from the "Contact Us" page.

#Database Structure
The database for this project should have at least one table to store contact form submissions. Here's a simple example of what the table structure might look like:

Table Name: contact_messages
Columns:
id (auto-incremented unique identifier)
name (sender's name)
email (sender's email address)
message (the content of the message)
timestamp (date and time of submission)
You can modify the structure as needed to suit your project requirements.

#Project Goals
The main goals of this project were:

To apply and strengthen my PHP programming skills.
To create a functional web application for managing messages received through a "Contact Us" form.
To gain experience in working with databases to store and retrieve user-generated content.

#Conclusion
This project allowed me to learn and apply PHP while creating a practical application for managing messages from a "Contact Us" page. It was a valuable experience, and I plan to continue building upon this foundation to explore more complex web development projects in the future.
